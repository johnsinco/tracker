# Tracker

Organize your day with a simple to-do / done app with some time-tracking and notification features, backed by Spring Boot API 
and ReactJS frontend.  Maybe with chrome notifications or text messages eventually.

Might just do this with a SPA in react and local storage, no backend needed.
